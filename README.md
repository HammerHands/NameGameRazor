# NameGameRazor

# Thursday:
Read problem and begain brainstorming a few ways to go about solving the problem:
1. Factory - Create a Question Producer for each type of question.
2. Module - Create a page and group functions of Games together

# Friday:
1. Begin setup of Razor Pages - Name Game
2. Create Reading of api

# Saturday:
1. Begin creation of Standard Page
2. First Read of Code Review and Notes on Code

# Sunday:
1. Finish Startup Page and Test(Exploratory)
2. Research Partial Views using Razor Pages

# Monday: 
1. Attempt Abstracting questions into a factory.
2. Using Logic of Standard Page create ReverseMode, TeamMode, and Mat(t) Mode
3. While creating these it occurred to me that ReverseMode and StandardMode could use the same logic just different views because there      was no filtering being done on the data.
3.1 Looked into possible ways using partials and abstracting logic, no luck after attempts.

4. Finish and record thoughts on code review.
